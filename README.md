# Description

This repo is for storing the changes I want in my local Witcher 2 mod.

There are a lot of nice mods out there but most of them only provide a binary... this is bad for several reasons

* Creates extra work before merging / add'l modifications can occur

* Many additional files that were NOT changed are bundled into the dzip file, which depending on what patch version of the game the mod was made from, could actually be reverting patch changes from the game.

I wanted to make a repo that *only* stores the files that are actually modified and perhaps a build script to overlay them in on top of extracted vanilla files and repack everything.

This would ensure that the latest versions are used wherever possible. This should make it easier to compare against smaller mods that are making simple changes and to only track what has changed from vanilla.

I am planning to use the excellent EMC mod as a base since it is both open-source and already encorporates a large number of the changes I am looking for.
